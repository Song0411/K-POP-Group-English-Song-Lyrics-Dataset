Every time I'm with you, like a time machine
Makin' everybody jealous like you seventeen

Got me feelin' like, "Damn"

Some things you can't fake it
Some things you just feel
Got plans we ain't made yet
It's whatever

You throwin' that drink back
You stayin' awhile
You rockin' that fit that's makin' all them strangers smile
