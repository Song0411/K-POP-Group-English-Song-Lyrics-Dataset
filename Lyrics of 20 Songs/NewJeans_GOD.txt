(Ayy) This is what you came for
Blood on the game ball
Everybody droppin' like rainfall
(Uh) This is your moment
Eyes on the pulpit, kid
I think church just opened

And they're singin' your praises, la-la-la
Screamin' your name out la-la-loud
One more step, you're immortal now 'cause

Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon' ride right into the sun
Like it's the day my kingdom come
Baby, we're

Go-Go-Go-Go-Go-Gods
Yeah, we're
Go-Go-Go-Go-Go-Gods

(Ayy) Welcome to the big show

Bad girl woke up and chose violence

And they're singin' my praises, la-la-la
Screamin' my name out la-la-loud
This is why we're immortal now 'cause

Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one (Crumble one by one)
Then we gon' ride right into the sun
Like it's the day my kingdom come
Baby, we're

Go-Go-Go-Go-Go-Gods
Yeah, we're
Go-Go-Go-Go-Go-Gods

I'm on my knees, pray for glory
Anyone read this underdog story?
I can't lose myself again
Help me raise this heart
Heart, unbreakable

Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one (Crumble one by one)
Then we gon' ride right into the sun
Like it's the day my kingdom come
Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon' ride right into the sun
Like it's the day my kingdom come
Baby, we're

Go-Go-Go-Go-Go-Gods
Yeah, we're (Gods)
Go-Go-Go-Go-Go-Gods
