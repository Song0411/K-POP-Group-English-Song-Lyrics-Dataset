It's the end of the month and the weekend

Check, check, check
Check that money, making bank, account number (Yikes!)
That's that shit that's never getting bounced on ya
Bitch, I do the money dance
I just made a hundred bands
When the store says, "Sign for it"
I'ma leave my autograph

Dollar bills, dollar bills
Watch it falling for me, I love the way that feels
Dollar bills, dollar bills
Keep on falling for me, I love the way it feels

I came here to drop some money
Dropping all my money
Drop some money
All this bread so yummy, yeah

Twerking, twerking, when I buy the things I like
Dollar, dollars dropping on my ass tonight

Everyone silent
Listen to my money talk
Spend how I like it
Yeah, everyone know what I mean, mean
When they see green, when they see green, that mean go
Give me what the hell I want
Give me what the hell I want
