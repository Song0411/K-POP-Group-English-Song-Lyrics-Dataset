I DO

Hit me like a shot in the heart (Oh-oh-oh)
Never shoulda played you so hard
Guess I played myself that's my fault (Um-um-um)

I don't even know how to think
'Cause now she got your heart so I feel
Stupid
Foolish
'Fraid I'm
Losing
Everything
I thought I couldn't
My whole world is falling apart

Don't you go falling in love
Trust me she's not the one
She won't ever
Love you like I do
Hold you like I do
Know you like I do

Don't you go falling in love
'Cause Imma break that shit up
I won't let her
Love you like I do
Touch you like I do
Nothing like I do
Nothing like I do

Hit me like a poisonous dart
You were trouble right from the start
Should have ran I guess it's my fault (Um-um-um)

I don't even know how to think
'Cause now she got your heart so I feel
Stupid
Foolish
'Fraid I'm
Losing
Everything
I thought I couldn't
My whole world is falling apart

Don't you go falling in love
Trust me she's not the one
She won't ever
Love you like I do
Hold you like I do
Know you like I do

Don't you go falling in love
'Cause Imma break that shit up
I won't let her
Love you like I do
Touch you like I do
Nothing like I do
Nothing like I do
