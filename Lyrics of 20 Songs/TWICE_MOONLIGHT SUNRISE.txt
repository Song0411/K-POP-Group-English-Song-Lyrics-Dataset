Oh, yeah
I guarantee I gotcha

I been craving for your love
Can't see nobody but us
So I, so I, so I
See you from across the room
Make my way over to you
I'm trippin' over butterflies

Oh yeah, baby, I don't really mean to rush
But I'ma really need your touch
If I'ma make it through the night
I got the moonlight
Tequila sunrise
Come take a shot on me, I gotcha

I don't know how to say this
I hope this song's on your playlist
This feeling's so hard to explain
I don't even know how to talk right now
It's I-need-you o'clock right now
I want you to hear me say

Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Oh baby, just to make you stay
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, let's do it all night
Moonlight sunrise
I guarantee I gotcha

Loving undefeated, on your knees pleading
Baby, you can hit up my line when you need it
Said that you tried, baby, you succeeded
Got a craving, baby, can you feed it?
Took a trip under moonlight
Follow me to the sunrise
Every day, every night
Ay, come with me, don't think twice

Oh yeah, baby, I don't really mean to rush (Oh yeah)
But I'ma really need your touch
If I'ma make it through the night
I got the moonlight
Tequila sunrise
Come take a shot on me, I gotcha

I don't know how to say this
I hope this song's on your playlist
This feeling's so hard to explain
I don't even know how to talk right now
It's I-need-you o'clock right now
I want you to hear me say

Moonlight sunrise
Baby, come be my starlight
Moonlight sunrise
Oh baby, just to make you stay
Moonlight sunrise
Baby, let's do it all night
Moonlight sunrise
I guarantee I gotcha

Cards out on the table, what you say?
I need you, you need me, you're mine
I'm your moonlight
You're my sunrise, babe
