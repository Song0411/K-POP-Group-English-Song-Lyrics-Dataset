Oh, oh, oh
Got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you
Oh, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time, do with my time

I wasn't ever sure that I loved you
But I was always sure you would let me down
I wasn't ever sure if I'd trust you
But I'm so goddamn sure my energy is just too precious to waste

So now you, now you wanna know me, wanna know me
You wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I left him alone
You know you wanna know me, you wanna know me
You wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I'm gone, no, no, no

That I, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you
Oh, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time, do with my time
Break it down
Oh I, better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you (Yes)

Wasn't ever sure if I loved you
But I was always sure you would have loved me back
You had me right, right, right at my weakest, yeah
Now you're hurting, I can see you're mad
'Cause you're never gonna get that back

Now I know you wanna know me, wanna know me
You wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I left him alone
You know you wanna know me, you wanna know me
You wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I'm gone, no, no, no

That I, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you
Oh, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time, do with my time
Break it down

I'm sorry that it hurts you
No, I'm sorry I ain't sorry
