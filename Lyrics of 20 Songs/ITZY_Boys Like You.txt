Why you're calling me up
Saying sorry again
Already told you we're done
What didn't you get?
Don't forget you're the one
That tried to get with my friends
The end the end the end the end

Well, you must be going crazy
Thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
'Cause you're crying like a baby
But do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror
If you wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up
You did it to yourself

Boy, gonna diss me?
Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me
Boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me?
Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna "What? No!"
Boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

I see through sweet little lies
And every excuse
When you start every fight
The blame is on you
One red flag and I'm gone already onto
The next, the next, the next
Well you must be going crazy
Thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
'Cause you're crying like a baby
But do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror
If you wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up
You did it to yourself

Boy, gonna diss me?
Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me
Boy, you are dismissed
Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me?
Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna "What? No!"
Boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

You can raise your voice
But know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (You)
You can raise your voice
But know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (You)

So turn around, walk away
You made your bed, so you gotta lay
Get outta my way

Boy, gonna diss me?
Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me
Boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me?
Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna "What? No!"
Boy, outta my way
Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (You)
You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (You)
Oh, you
