Hit me like a shot in the heart (Oh-oh-oh)
Never shoulda played you so hard
Guess I played myself that's my fault (Um-um-um)

I don't even know how to think
'Cause now she got your heart so I feel
Stupid
Foolish
'Fraid I'm
Losing
Everything
I thought I couldn't
My whole world is falling apart

Don't you go falling in love
Trust me she's not the one
She won't ever
Love you like I do
Hold you like I do
Know you like I do

Don't you go falling in love
'Cause Imma break that shit up
I won't let her
Love you like I do
Touch you like I do
Nothing like I do
Nothing like I do

Hit me like a poisonous dart
You were trouble right from the start
Should have ran I guess it's my fault (Um-um-um)

I don't even know how to think
'Cause now she got your heart so I feel
Stupid
Foolish
'Fraid I'm
Losing
Everything
I thought I couldn't
My whole world is falling apart

Don't you go falling in love
Trust me she's not the one
She won't ever
Love you like I do
Hold you like I do
Know you like I do

Don't you go falling in love
'Cause Imma break that shit up
I won't let her

Touch you like I do
Nothing like I do

I want that all matte big black S-U-V
I want that, I want that
I want the oh, my, oh, my, O-M-G
I want that right now, that you and me
I want that, oui, merci, no, c'est la vie
I want that, I want that

Don't stop, we run through the yellows
We go pedal to the metal
Then on stage collecting the medals
We here, ain't no higher level
If you wondering, I'm too hot for layers
See you only when I come up for air
Get you tongue tied, don't know what to say, I–
What? Huh?

I want you to fall, hardest of all
Until the tears roll down your face
Saying my name or nothing at all
I only want everything

I want the oh, my, oh, my, O-M-G

Green light, stop doing nothing
Start pushing, loosen my buttons
Share one seat from L.A. to London (Uh)
This could turn into something
We could do this all up and down the coastline
If you wanna come in close, no, I don't bite
Get on over here, and don’t fight the moonlight (Oh)

I want you to fall, hardest of all
Until the tears roll down your face
Saying my name or nothing at all
I only want everything

I want the oh, my, oh, my, O-M-G

It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started

When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say

I wanna dance
The music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans
And live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools

We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk
Just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need Permission to Dance

There's always something that's standing in the way
But if you don't let it faze ya
You'll know just how to break
Just keep the right vibe, yeah
'Cause there's no looking back
There ain't no one to prove
We don't got this on lock, yeah

The wait is over
The time is now
So let's do it right
Yeah, we'll keep going
And stay up until we see the sunrise
And we'll say

I wanna dance

Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans
And live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools

Don't need to talk the talk

A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
(Cupid is so dumb)

Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid

Blood on the game ball
Everybody droppin' like rainfall
(Uh) This is your moment
Eyes on the pulpit, kid
I think church just opened

And they're singin' your praises, la-la-la
Screamin' your name out la-la-loud
One more step, you're immortal now 'cause

Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon' ride right into the sun

Next on the ladder
Is it your name in the rafters?
Brief, brief, brief moment of silence
Bad girl woke up and chose violence

And they're singin' my praises, la-la-la
Screamin' my name out la-la-loud
This is why we're immortal now 'cause

Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one (Crumble one by one)

Anyone read this underdog story?
I can't lose myself again
Help me raise this heart
Heart, unbreakable

Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one (Crumble one by one)
Then we gon' ride right into the sun

I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot
It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost
Oh, yeah
I'm tired of always waiting
Oh, yeah, yeah
I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls
I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved
Oh, yeah, yeah
I really gotta face it
Oh, yeah, yeah

I just wanna be the one
But to you we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone, crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (All because of you)

Another story that's sad and true
I can feel the pain, can you?
You had to be the one to let me down to color me blue
Hate to see you with someone new
I'll put a curse on her and you
Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone
My love is gone too

All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
All my love is gone
Now you're dead and gone

All my love is gone and the hate has grown
Standing all alone
And I'm searching for something
But I can't feel nothing
I pack my bags and go
This don't feel like home
Too much darkness for a rainbow
I feel so used
How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse (Yeah)

I just wanna be the one
But to you we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone, crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (All because of you)

My life's been magic seems fantastic
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
It's funny when you want it
Suddenly you have it
You find out that your gold's just plastic

Every day every night
I've been thinking back on you and I
Every day every night

I worked my whole life
Just to get right just to be like
Look at me, I'm never coming down

I worked my whole life
Just to get high just to realize
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground

Nah but they don't hear me though
(Yeah what goes up it must come down)
Nah but they don't hear me though
(You're running out of time)

My world's been hectic seems electric
But I've been waking up with your voice in my head
And I'm trying to send a message
And let you know that every single minute
I'm without you, I regret it

Every day every night
I've been thinking back on you and I
Every day every night

I worked my whole life
Just to get right just to be like
Look at me, I'm never coming down
I worked my whole life
Just to get high just to realize

Nah but they don't hear me though

Nah but they don't hear me though
(You're running out of time)

I'm way up in the clouds
And they say I've made it now
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the ground

Just drove by your house
So far from you now
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground
Nah but they don't hear me though

You know, without you, I'm so lonely
When you're not here, 911 calling
Into your heat again, I'm diving
Darling, you, darling, you, baby

(Mm) 'Cause I know that our love was hotter than the Sun
Yeah, the taste of this tequila I'm drinking now
Isn't bitter than my heart

I want to know our problem, blood type, or DNA

Been waiting for your call every night
But I can't wait no more

Don't wanna say goodbye

Comin' back for more, ayy

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, it all makes sense
And I know you don't feel no different
Woah-ooh
There's a magic to how we livin'
There's a magic to what this is
It's like a dream and we both day-trippin'
Woah-ooh

All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something
There'll be things you can't replace
All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something
Baby, that's okay, 'cause

I can see you comin' back for more

I can see you comin' back for more (Can you?)
