Hit me like a shot in the heart (Oh-oh-oh)
Never shoulda played you so hard
Guess I played myself that's my fault (Um-um-um)

I don't even know how to think
'Cause now she got your heart so I feel
Stupid
Foolish
'Fraid I'm
Losing
Everything
I thought I couldn't
My whole world is falling apart

Don't you go falling in love
Trust me she's not the one
She won't ever
Love you like I do
Hold you like I do
Know you like I do

Don't you go falling in love
'Cause Imma break that shit up
I won't let her
Love you like I do
Touch you like I do
Nothing like I do
Nothing like I do

Hit me like a poisonous dart
You were trouble right from the start
Should have ran I guess it's my fault (Um-um-um)

Don't stop, we run through the yellows
We go pedal to the metal
Then on stage collecting the medals
We here, ain't no higher level
If you wondering, I'm too hot for layers
See you only when I come up for air
Get you tongue tied, don't know what to say, I–
What? Huh?

I want you to fall, hardest of all
Until the tears roll down your face
Saying my name or nothing at all

Green light, stop doing nothing
Start pushing, loosen my buttons
Share one seat from L.A. to London (Uh)
This could turn into something
We could do this all up and down the coastline
If you wanna come in close, no, I don't bite
Get on over here, and don’t fight the moonlight (Oh)

La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
(Cupid is so dumb)

Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real

a hopeless romantic all my life
surrounded by couples all the time
i guess i should take it as a sign
oh why oh why oh why oh why

im feeling lonely lonely
oh i wish id find a lover that could hold me hold me
now im crying in my room
so skeptical of love say what you say but i want it more
but still i want it more more more

i gave a second chance to cupid
but now im left here feeling stupid
oh the way he makes me feel
that love isnt real
cupid is so dumb

i look for his arrows every day
i guess he got lost or flew away
waiting around is a waste waste
been counting the days since november
is loving as good as they say

now im so lonely lonely
oh i wish id find a lover that could hold me hold me
now im crying in my room
so skeptical of love say what you say but i want it more
but still i want it more more more

i gave a second chance to cupid
but now im left here feeling stupid
oh the way he makes me feel
that love isnt real
cupid is so dumb

hopeless girl is seeking
someone who will share this feeling
im a fool

Why you're calling me up
Saying sorry again
Already told you we're done
What didn't you get?
Don't forget you're the one
That tried to get with my friends
The end the end the end the end

Well, you must be going crazy
Thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
'Cause you're crying like a baby
But do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror
If you wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up
You did it to yourself

I don't care 'bout your first love
This should be your last one

Drop a red light and we'll sing it, ""Goodbye""

Don't start blowing up my line

I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot
It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost
Oh, yeah
I'm tired of always waiting
Oh, yeah, yeah
I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls
I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved
Oh, yeah, yeah
I really gotta face it
Oh, yeah, yeah

I just wanna be the one
But to you we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone, crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (All because of you)

Another story that's sad and true
I can feel the pain, can you?
You had to be the one to let me down to color me blue
Hate to see you with someone new
I'll put a curse on her and you
Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone
My love is gone too

All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
All my love is gone
Now you're dead and gone

All my love is gone and the hate has grown
Standing all alone
And I'm searching for something
But I can't feel nothing
I pack my bags and go
This don't feel like home
Too much darkness for a rainbow
I feel so used
How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse (Yeah)

I just wanna be the one
But to you we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone, crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb

My life's been magic seems fantastic
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
It's funny when you want it
Suddenly you have it
You find out that your gold's just plastic

Every day every night
I've been thinking back on you and I
Every day every night

I worked my whole life
Just to get right just to be like
Look at me, I'm never coming down

I worked my whole life
Just to get high just to realize
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground

Nah but they don't hear me though
(Yeah what goes up it must come down)
Nah but they don't hear me though
(You're running out of time)

My world's been hectic seems electric
But I've been waking up with your voice in my head
And I'm trying to send a message
And let you know that every single minute
I'm without you, I regret it

Every day every night

I'm way up in the clouds
And they say I've made it now
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the ground

Just drove by your house
So far from you now
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the

When you're not here, 911 calling
Into your heat again, I'm diving
Darling, you, darling, you, baby

There's a magic to what this is
It's like a dream and we both day-trippin'
